# app_simonero
A Genero version of the classic Simon game

I originaly wrote this app during the early days of Genero Mobile at about the same time as Pool Doctors. It didn't really go anywhere as it ...
* used functionality such as the PlaySound front-call which wasn't a priority to implement with Genero Mobile
* did a few naughty things to get non 1 second time inervals, and timers to respond if user did not respond that again were not a priority to implement into the Genero language
* was tricky getting a consistent user interface across the 4 Genero User Interface clients of the time.  I was aiming for 6 pieces that took up 100% of the screen in a 3x2 pattern

I really wanted to get the Genero 'g' icon used as the button

I was doing a tidyup on my computer and didn't want to lose it so have added to my personal repository, one day I might dig it out and polish it off
